12-HOUR TIME PLUGIN

Not all of us are adept at those exotic, 24-hour clocks. So for the rest of us,
here's a simple plugin that tacks on an AM/PM selector to the DateHelper
methods. It also handles the backend, so things are properly stored in 24-hour
format.

USAGE:

  <%= time_select 'event', 'time', {:twelve_hour => true} %>
