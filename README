= Concurrent Draft

Created by: Andrew vonderLuft and Sean Cribbs, August 2008, in Portland Oregon

The ConcurrentDraft extension enables default draft versions of pages, snippets and layouts, which can be scheduled for promotion to Production.
Every page, snippet and layout hence can have a concurrent draft and production version.

== Installation

From the root of your radiant app:

$ cd vendor/extensions                                          ## go to the radiant extensions directory
$ git clone git://github.com/avonderluft/concurrent_draft.git   ## use http://github.com/... if you are behind a firewall that blocks SSH
$ cd ../../                                                     ## go back to root of radiant app
$ rake radiant:extensions:concurrent_draft:migrate              ## Run the migration to update the models
$ rake radiant:extensions:concurrent_draft:update               ## Copies assets   

Restart your radiant app, and you should be good to go.
   
== Acknowledgments

Andrew conceived of the ideas for this extension and its initial design,  and did model changes, migrations, and initial code for pages.
Sean collaborated on its expansion and refactoring to include snippets and layouts, and produced most of the final code, including all of the UI.

After some discussion, they both rightly identified the mystery piece as a Haydn Cello concerto.
