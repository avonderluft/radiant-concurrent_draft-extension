= Concurrent Draft

Created by: Andrew vonderLuft and Sean Cribbs, August 2008, in Portland Oregon

The ConcurrentDraft extension enables default draft versions of pages, snippets and layouts, which can be scheduled for promotion to Production.
Every page, snippet and layout hence can have a concurrent draft and production version.

== Requirements

If you running Radiant version 0.6.9 or earlier, you will need to use radiant edge.  To install edge for your Radiant project,
run this from your Radiant root:
$ rake radiant:freeze:edge

== Installation

With the Radiant Extensions registry:

From your Radiant root run:

$ script/extension install concurrent_draft

Restart your radiant app, and you should be good to go.

== Caveats

Scheduled times are dependent on the ActiveRecord time setting.  If you want to use local time, add this to your environment.rb
config.active_record.default_timezone = :local
   
== Acknowledgments

Andrew conceived of the ideas for this extension and its initial design,  and did model changes, migrations, and initial code for pages.
Sean collaborated on its expansion and refactoring to include snippets and layouts, and produced most of the final code, including all of the UI.

After some discussion, they both rightly identified the mystery piece as a Haydn Cello concerto.
