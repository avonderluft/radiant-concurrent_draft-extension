h2. Concurrent Draft

The *ConcurrentDraft* extension enables draft versions of pages, snippets and layouts, which can be scheduled for promotion to Production.  Every such artifact (page, snippet or layout) can have a concurrent draft version, which will be displayed in development mode, and a promoted live version, which will be displayed in production mode.

Created by: Andrew vonderLuft and Sean Cribbs, August 2008, in Portland Oregon

h3. Installation

h4. With the Radiant Extensions registry:

* From your Radiant root run:

<pre>script/extension install concurrent_draft
rake radiant:extensions:concurrent_draft:migrate
rake radiant:extensions:concurrent_draft:update  
</pre>

* Restart your radiant app, and you should be good to go.

h4. Using the gem

* Install the gem

<pre>gem install radiant-concurrent_draft-extension</pre>

* Update your Radiant config:  add to environment.rb with other gem.configs

<pre>config.gem 'radiant-concurrent_draft-extension', :lib => false</pre>


h3. Caveats

Scheduled times are dependent on the ActiveRecord time setting.  If you want to use local time, add this to your environment.rb:

<pre>config.active_record.default_timezone = :local</pre>

h3. Acknowledgments

* Andrew conceived of the ideas for this extension and its initial design,  and did model changes, migrations, and initial code for pages.
* Sean collaborated on its expansion and refactoring to include snippets and layouts, and produced most of the final code, including all of the UI.
* Andrew refactored the UI for Radiant 0.9 and higher, added i18n, and gemified the extension.
* After some discussion, they rightly identified the mystery piece as a Haydn Cello concerto.
