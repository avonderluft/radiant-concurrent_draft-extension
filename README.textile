h2. Concurrent Draft

The _ConcurrentDraft_ extension enables default draft versions of pages, snippets and layouts, which can be scheduled for promotion to Production.  Every page, snippet and layout hence can have a concurrent draft (dev) and production version.

Created by: Andrew vonderLuft and Sean Cribbs, August 2008, in Portland Oregon

h3. Acknowledgments

* Andrew conceived of the ideas for this extension and its initial design,  and did model changes, migrations, and initial code for pages.
* Sean collaborated on its expansion and refactoring to include snippets and layouts, and produced most of the final code, including all of the UI.
* After some discussion, they both rightly identified the mystery piece as a Haydn Cello concerto.
